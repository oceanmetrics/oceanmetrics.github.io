### Our Approach

We combine multiple data sources including:

- Satellite remote sensing data
- In-situ measurements from buoys and research vessels
- Historical oceanographic databases
- Real-time sensor networks

This integrated approach provides a holistic view of ocean health, enabling better understanding of:

- Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems
- Ocean acidification trends
- Marine biodiversity patterns
- Pollution distribution and impacts
- Sustainable fisheries management
