## Ocean Metrics Applications

Our platform offers a suite of applications designed to address critical ocean health challenges. Each application provides specialized tools and visualizations for different aspects of ocean monitoring and analysis.

### Available Applications

::: {.applications-grid}

#### 🌡️ [Ocean Temperature Monitoring](examples/ocean-temperature.qmd)
Track sea surface temperature anomalies, marine heatwaves, and long-term warming trends across global ocean basins. Essential for understanding climate change impacts on marine ecosystems.

#### 🧪 Ocean Acidification Tracker
Monitor pH levels and aragonite saturation states to assess ocean acidification impacts on coral reefs and shell-forming organisms. Includes projections under different emission scenarios.

#### 🐟 Marine Biodiversity Index
Visualize species distribution, abundance trends, and biodiversity hotspots. Integrates data from global observation networks to support conservation planning.

#### 🚢 Maritime Traffic Analysis
Analyze shipping routes, vessel density, and potential impacts on marine mammals. Includes noise pollution modeling and collision risk assessments.

#### 🏭 Pollution Monitoring Dashboard
Track plastic pollution, chemical contaminants, and nutrient runoff. Features real-time alerts for pollution events and trend analysis tools.

#### 🎣 Sustainable Fisheries Tool
Assess fish stock health, catch trends, and compliance with sustainable fishing practices. Supports evidence-based fisheries management decisions.

#### 🌊 Coastal Vulnerability Assessment
Evaluate coastal erosion, sea level rise impacts, and storm surge risks. Helps communities prepare for climate change impacts.

#### 🏝️ Coral Reef Health Monitor
Track coral bleaching events, reef recovery, and resilience indicators. Combines satellite imagery with in-situ observations for comprehensive monitoring.
